During the 1970s and 1980s, the prevailing concept was that HIT was associated only with arterial thrombosis, through its unique pathogenesis via heparin-dependent, platelet-activating IgG antibodies. However, in 1990, when I began to encounter HIT in my clinical practice, I found that most such patients developed symptomatic venous thrombosis. This historical sketch summarizes some of the research that challenged the dogma of HIT being a mainly arterial prothrombotic disorder. Two studies - one a substudy of a randomized trial of post-orthopedic surgery thromboprophylaxis, and the second a retrospective five-hospital analysis of consecutive patients with positive test results for HIT antibodies - showed a marked predominance of venous over arterial thrombosis complicating HIT (~\u00a04\u00a0:\u00a01). By the end of the 1990s, an even more dramatic manifestation of HIT-associated venous thrombosis was recognized: venous limb gangrene. Here, ischemic limb necrosis occurs despite palpable arterial pulses, as a result of both macrovascular and microvascular venous thrombosis. The surprising explanation was natural anticoagulant impairment (severe depletion of protein\u00a0C, a vitamin\u00a0K-dependent anticoagulant) resulting from treatment of HIT-associated deep vein thrombosis with warfarin (vitamin\u00a0K antagonist). These insights from HIT research helped to elucidate the pathogenesis of ischemic limb losses in other intense non-HIT hypercoagulability states, including warfarin-associated venous limb gangrene complicating cancer-associated hypercoagulability, and symmetrical peripheral gangrene complicating disseminated intravascular coagulation of critical illness, in which proximate 'shock liver' helps to explain the profound failure of natural anticoagulant systems (protein\u00a0C; antithrombin) in predisposing to peripheral limb microthrombosis in circulatory shock.", "source_id": "30099843", "source": "pubmed", "ctv_codes": []}, {"text": "The purpose of this article was to describe our experience with the prenatal diagnosis of CHD in patients referred to our Fetal Cardiology Unit.", "source_id": "31257961", "source": "pubmed", "ctv_codes": []}, {"text": "This review reports main progresses in various pediatric issues published in Italian Journal of Pediatrics and in international journals in 2016.

The true septal components are surrounded by grooves, which themselves largely represent infolding of the atrial walls. These anatomical features can now accurately be revealed using virtual dissection of CT data sets. These images, when carefully reconstructed, demonstrated the anatomy with as much accuracy as when hearts are dissected in the autopsy room. Such virtual dissection, furthermore, shows the components as they are seen within the chest, thus facilitating understanding for those intending to undertake interventional therapeutic procedures.

Changes in guidelines for cholesterol mangement focusing on the identification of \"statin eligible groups\" and removal of actual low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) targets, in particular, as well as lower targets for blood pressure in updated hypertension guidelines, have made a major impact on healthcare. The availability of the sodium glucose transport protein-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide -1 receptor antagonists (GLP1-RA) for managing diabetes have shifted our focus in diabetes care beyond glucose lowering to addressing cardiovascular risk reduction. While many prior trials of fish oil therapy have failed to show benefit, the recent Reduction of Cardiovascular Events With EPA - Intervention Trial (REDUCE-IT) testing the efficacy of icosapent ethyl has shown dramatic benefit in further addressing residual atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk beyond statin therapy not only in those with known ASCVD, but also in diabetic patients with multiple risk factors. The past decade also ushered in confirmation of the inflammation hypothesis of atherosclerosis with the Canakinumab Anti-Inflammatory Thrombosis Outcomes Study (CANTOS) using canakinumab, despite the fact the therapy was not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for cardiovascular risk reduction. Also, to improve our understanding of heart disease in women, the emergence of novel concepts of ischemia or myocardial infarction in those with normal or nonobstructive atherosclerotic disease has been a major advance.

The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Clinical Guideline (CG)168, published in July 2013, sought to improve care of patients with leg ulcers, recommending that patients with a break in the skin below the knee that had not healed within two weeks be referred to a specialist vascular service for diagnosis and management. Aim Determine the impact of CG168 on referrals to a leg ulcer service. Methods Patients referred with leg ulceration during an 18-month period prior to CG168 (January 2012-June 2013) and an 18-month period commencing six months after (January 2014-June 2015) publication of CG168 were compared. Results There was a two-fold increase in referrals (181 patients, 220 legs vs. 385 patients, 453 legs) but no change in mean age, gender or median-duration of ulcer at referral (16.6 vs. 16.2 weeks). Mean-time from referral to specialist appointment increased (4.8 vs. 6 weeks, p\u2009=\u20090.0001), as did legs with superficial venous insufficiency (SVI) (36% vs. 44%, p\u2009=\u20090.05). There was a trend towards more SVI endovenous interventions (32% vs. 39%, p\u2009=\u20090.271) with an increase in endothermal (2 vs. 32 legs, p\u2009=\u20090.001) but no change in sclerotherapy (24 vs. 51 legs) treatments. Conclusions Since CG168, there has been a considerable increase in leg ulcer referrals. However, patients are still not referred until ulceration has been present for many months. Although many ulcers are multi-factorial and the mainstay of treatment remains compression, there has been an increase in SVI endovenous intervention.

In this, our third exercise in cardiac anatomy, we address the issue of classification of ventricular septal defects. We begin our demonstration by analysing the normal heart. We show that the larger part of the ventricular septum is made up of its muscular component. The membranous part accounts for only a small portion, which is located centrally within the cardiac base. This small membranous part forms a boundary between the right-sided chambers and the aortic root. Holes at this site, therefore, which account for the commonest defects closed surgically, will open centrally in the cardiac base, being located postero-inferiorly relative to the supraventricular crest. We then show that the larger part of the crest itself is a free-standing muscular sleeve, which lifts the leaflets of the pulmonary valve away from the cardiac base. Only a very small part of the muscle forming the right ventricular outlet is located in the septal position. Turning our attention to malformed hearts, we show how holes between the ventricles can open centrally at the cardiac base, open to the inlet or outlet of the right ventricle or open within the substance of the apical muscular septum. We illustrate how it is the phenotypic features, as seen from the right ventricle, which convey the crucial information for the surgeon with regard to the location of the atrioventricular conduction axis, using hearts with holes opening to the inlet of the right ventricle with muscular as opposed to partially fibrous borders to emphasize this point. We continue by showing how holes with different phenotypes can also open to the outlet of the right ventricle, the key feature in this regard being malalignment between the apical muscular septum relative to the muscular outlet septum or its fibrous remnant. Malalignment can also be found between the apical ventricular septum and the atrial septum, this being shown in a defect opening to the inlet of the right ventricle.

It remains very important, however, for general cardiologists to have a good understanding of many aspects of adult congenital heart disease, including common pitfalls to avoid and, importantly, when to refer on, to a specialist centre. To help healthcare providers across the spectrum of cardiology practice to address common themes in adult congenital heart disease, this state-of-the-art review provides a series of case vignettes to illustrate frequent diagnostic problems that we have seen in our tertiary-level adult congenital heart disease centres, which are sometimes encountered in general cardiology settings.

During the 1970s and 1980s, the prevailing concept was that HIT was associated only with arterial thrombosis, through its unique pathogenesis via heparin-dependent, platelet-activating IgG antibodies. However, in 1990, when I began to encounter HIT in my clinical practice, I found that most such patients developed symptomatic venous thrombosis. This historical sketch summarizes some of the research that challenged the dogma of HIT being a mainly arterial prothrombotic disorder. Two studies - one a substudy of a randomized trial of post-orthopedic surgery thromboprophylaxis, and the second a retrospective five-hospital analysis of consecutive patients with positive test results for HIT antibodies - showed a marked predominance of venous over arterial thrombosis complicating HIT (~\u00a04\u00a0:\u00a01). By the end of the 1990s, an even more dramatic manifestation of HIT-associated venous thrombosis was recognized: venous limb gangrene. Here, ischemic limb necrosis occurs despite palpable arterial pulses, as a result of both macrovascular and microvascular venous thrombosis. The surprising explanation was natural anticoagulant impairment (severe depletion of protein\u00a0C, a vitamin\u00a0K-dependent anticoagulant) resulting from treatment of HIT-associated deep vein thrombosis with warfarin (vitamin\u00a0K antagonist). These insights from HIT research helped to elucidate the pathogenesis of ischemic limb losses in other intense non-HIT hypercoagulability states, including warfarin-associated venous limb gangrene complicating cancer-associated hypercoagulability, and symmetrical peripheral gangrene complicating disseminated intravascular coagulation of critical illness, in which proximate 'shock liver' helps to explain the profound failure of natural anticoagulant systems (protein\u00a0C; antithrombin) in predisposing to peripheral limb microthrombosis in circulatory shock.", "source_id": "30099843", "source": "pubmed", "ctv_codes": []}, {"text": "Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are the most common manifestations of venous thromboembolism (VTE).

We studied the clinical presentation, site of thrombosis and risk factors based on the anatomic distribution of lower limb DVT. Methods A retrospective analysis of clinically suspected DVT cases was conducted between 2008 and 2012. DVT was categorized by the location of the thrombosed segment and limb involved. The DVT anatomic segments were assessed according to left-to-right ratio, predisposing factors and clinical presentations. Results A total of 637 patients with DVT were included with a mean age of 50\u2009\u00b1\u200917 years (51%; females). DVT was more common at the left side, with a left-to-right ratio of 1.5:1. Bilateral DVT cases (38.5%) had more prior history of DVT as compared to left- (20.3%) and right-sided DVTs (22.6%); p\u2009=\u20090.01. Bilateral DVT was complicated more with post-thrombotic syndrome (leg ulcer) ( p\u2009=\u20090.02). The rates of pulmonary embolism (25%) and mortality (23.1%) were significantly higher for bilateral DVT in comparison to left- and right-sided DVT. Conclusion Lower limb DVTs are more common at the left side; however, patients with bilateral DVT have higher frequency of recurrence, post-thrombotic syndrome, pulmonary embolism and mortality.

During the 1970s and 1980s, the prevailing concept was that HIT was associated only with arterial thrombosis, through its unique pathogenesis via heparin-dependent, platelet-activating IgG antibodies. However, in 1990, when I began to encounter HIT in my clinical practice, I found that most such patients developed symptomatic venous thrombosis. This historical sketch summarizes some of the research that challenged the dogma of HIT being a mainly arterial prothrombotic disorder. Two studies - one a substudy of a randomized trial of post-orthopedic surgery thromboprophylaxis, and the second a retrospective five-hospital analysis of consecutive patients with positive test results for HIT antibodies - showed a marked predominance of venous over arterial thrombosis complicating HIT (~\u00a04\u00a0:\u00a01). By the end of the 1990s, an even more dramatic manifestation of HIT-associated venous thrombosis was recognized: venous limb gangrene. Here, ischemic limb necrosis occurs despite palpable arterial pulses, as a result of both macrovascular and microvascular venous thrombosis. The surprising explanation was natural anticoagulant impairment (severe depletion of protein\u00a0C, a vitamin\u00a0K-dependent anticoagulant) resulting from treatment of HIT-associated deep vein thrombosis with warfarin (vitamin\u00a0K antagonist). These insights from HIT research helped to elucidate the pathogenesis of ischemic limb losses in other intense non-HIT hypercoagulability states, including warfarin-associated venous limb gangrene complicating cancer-associated hypercoagulability, and symmetrical peripheral gangrene complicating disseminated intravascular coagulation of critical illness, in which proximate 'shock liver' helps to explain the profound failure of natural anticoagulant systems (protein\u00a0C; antithrombin) in predisposing to peripheral limb microthrombosis in circulatory shock.", "source_id": "30099843", "source": "pubmed", "ctv_codes": []}, {"text": "Even today thromboangiitis obliterans has disease features that remain misunderstood or underappreciated.

In this, our third exercise in cardiac anatomy, we address the issue of classification of ventricular septal defects. We begin our demonstration by analysing the normal heart. We show that the larger part of the ventricular septum is made up of its muscular component. The membranous part accounts for only a small portion, which is located centrally within the cardiac base. This small membranous part forms a boundary between the right-sided chambers and the aortic root. Holes at this site, therefore, which account for the commonest defects closed surgically, will open centrally in the cardiac base, being located postero-inferiorly relative to the supraventricular crest. We then show that the larger part of the crest itself is a free-standing muscular sleeve, which lifts the leaflets of the pulmonary valve away from the cardiac base. Only a very small part of the muscle forming the right ventricular outlet is located in the septal position. Turning our attention to malformed hearts, we show how holes between the ventricles can open centrally at the cardiac base, open to the inlet or outlet of the right ventricle or open within the substance of the apical muscular septum. We illustrate how it is the phenotypic features, as seen from the right ventricle, which convey the crucial information for the surgeon with regard to the location of the atrioventricular conduction axis, using hearts with holes opening to the inlet of the right ventricle with muscular as opposed to partially fibrous borders to emphasize this point.

It is important to understand that when blood pressure (BP) is falling, SVR and CO do not change reciprocally as they do in the steady state. In 1932, Lewis, assuming that decreased SVR alone accounted for hypotension, defined \"the vasovagal response\" along pathophysiologic lines to denote the association of vasodilation with vagal-induced bradycardia in simple faint. Studies performed by Barcroft and Sharpey-Schafer between 1940 and 1950 used volume-based plethysmography to demonstrate major forearm vasodilation during extreme hypotension and concluded that the main mechanism for hypotension was vasodilation. Plethysmographic measurements were intermittent and not frequent enough to capture rapid changes in blood flow during progressive hypotension. However, later investigations by Weissler, Murray, and Stevens performed between 1950 and 1970 used invasive beat-to-beat BP measurements and more frequent measurements of CO using the Fick principle.

Methods The systematic review of the literature focused on the use of Micronized Purified Flavonoid Fraction (diosmin) which has recently become available in the US, in the management of chronic venous disease. The primary goal was to assess the level of evidence of the role of Micronized Purified Flavonoid Fraction in the healing of ulcers, and secondarily on the improvement of the symptoms of chronic venous disease such as edema. Other elements of the study design were to note specifically the type of compression therapy used in conjunction with Micronized Purified Flavonoid Fraction. Conclusion In summary, the general level of evidence supports the recommendation that the use of medical therapy with Micronized Purified Flavonoid Fraction has beneficial outcomes without serious adverse events. In the United States, diosmiplex is the only available prescription formulation of Micronized Purified Flavonoid Fraction. It is derived from the rinds of oranges and is categorized as a medical food and not as a drug; and may be a particularly attractive therapy for many chronic venous disease patients because of its favorable safety profile. The Working Group for chronic venous disease concurs with previous guidance by the International European Society for Vascular Surgery in 2015 which recommended the use of Micronized Purified Flavonoid Fraction for the healing of venous ulcers, alone and adjunctive to compression therapy, and for the reduction in symptoms of chronic venous disease such as edema.", "source_id": "28211296", "source": "pubmed", "ctv_codes": []}, {"text": "Here, we summarize knowledge on novel approaches emerging from the TE scenario.

Different patterns of perivascular hyalinisation in different viscera are clues to the varying causes and consequences of arteriolar injury. In the uterus there is a symmetrical, perivascular \"halo of hyalinisation\" that marks the lines of extension of regenerating, injured nerves to the placental bed, whereas in the kidney there is a disordered and asymmetrical \"halo of hyalinisation\" where persistent, and recurrent, increases in intravascular pressures interrupt development of regenerating nerves. Consequences of injuries to vasomotor nerves include releasing a \"soup\" of cytokines that cause regeneration of \"new\" nerves expressing primitive, pain and stretch receptors including TRPV-1 and P2X3 purinergic \"stretch\" receptors that may be significant in the afferent mechanism in preeclampsia. There is also concurrent, \"background\" hyperplasia of denervated tunica media and intima leading to narrowing of the arterioles and a further drive to hypertension through renal ischaemia (Goldblatt, 1942).

It is important to understand that when blood pressure (BP) is falling, SVR and CO do not change reciprocally as they do in the steady state. In 1932, Lewis, assuming that decreased SVR alone accounted for hypotension, defined \"the vasovagal response\" along pathophysiologic lines to denote the association of vasodilation with vagal-induced bradycardia in simple faint. Studies performed by Barcroft and Sharpey-Schafer between 1940 and 1950 used volume-based plethysmography to demonstrate major forearm vasodilation during extreme hypotension and concluded that the main mechanism for hypotension was vasodilation. Plethysmographic measurements were intermittent and not frequent enough to capture rapid changes in blood flow during progressive hypotension. However, later investigations by Weissler, Murray, and Stevens performed between 1950 and 1970 used invasive beat-to-beat BP measurements and more frequent measurements of CO using the Fick principle.

For emergency physicians, critical care physicians, hospitalists, cardiologists, internists, surgeons, and family physicians, the current approach and disease indications for treatment with anticoagulants such as coumadin, factor IIa, and factor Xa inhibitors are particularly relevant. When a patient treated with anticoagulants presents to the emergency department, intensive care unit, or operating room with severe, uncontrollable bleeding, achieving rapid, controlled hemostasis is critically important to save the patient's life. The first section provides a description of the current indications for the treatment of patients using oral anticoagulants including coumadin, the factor IIa (thrombin) inhibitor dabigatran, and factor Xa inhibitors such as apixaban and rivaroxaban. In the remaining sections, the treatment of patients presenting to the hospital with major bleeding becomes the focus. The replacement of blood components including red blood cells, platelets, and clotting factors is the critically important initial treatment for these individuals. For patients treated with coumadin, infusion of vitamin K helps to initiate the process of protein synthesis for the vitamin K-dependent coagulation proteins II, VII, IX, and X and the antithrombotic protein C and protein S. Repletion of clotting factors for the patient with 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate, which includes factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX, and X and therapeutically effective concentrations of the regulatory proteins (protein C and S), provides real-time ability to slow bleeding. For patients treated with the thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, treatment using the highly specific, antibody-derived idarucizumab has been demonstrated to reverse the hypocoagulable state of the patient to allow blood clotting. In May 2018, andexanet alfa was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to reverse the factor Xa anticoagulants apixaban and rivaroxaban in patients with major bleeding. Before the availability of this highly specific agent, therapy for patients treated with factor Xa inhibitors presenting with severe bleeding usually included replacement of lost blood components including red blood cells, platelets, and clotting factors and 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate, or if not available, fresh frozen plasma.

These challenges, which are inherent in studying pregnancy in physiologic and pathologic states, have contributed to the scant research in pregnancy. Until recently, most studies in pregnancy were nonrandomized and retrospective in nature, representing prevailing clinical standards of practice and clinicians' biases. Prospective studies were generally limited to single centers, comprising of small sample sizes and were observational in nature, rather than randomized studies involving therapy. Ethical and legal factors, research mandates, patient factors, the protracted nature of pregnancy, institutional commitment to research, interdisciplinary clinical and research collaboration, funding support, administrative issues and the level of involvement of national cardiac and obstetric and gynecological societies have been barriers to research in pregnancy in developed countries. Even prospective observational studies are difficult to perform due the difficulties involved with obtaining consent, study recruitment and follow-up. The longitudinal nature of prospective studies in pregnancy, the problems associated with enrolling women before pregnancy and in the first trimester and the failure to understand the commitment required by the patient, as well as many social factors, have led to increased drop-out rates during pregnancy, as well as difficulty with follow-up in the post-partum state. These factors, along with the failure to supplement funding support due to longer study periods than anticipated, have led to studies of small sample sizes. Understanding patient factors that lead to a lack of participation in research or dropping out following initial consent could help make research participation more conducive for pregnant women. The involvement of national societies in the planning and funding of multicenter studies, interdepartmental and interinstitutional collaboration, institutional and extramural funding support and patient incentives are crucial for shortening study duration and ensuring adequacy of sample sizes for successful research in pregnancy.
