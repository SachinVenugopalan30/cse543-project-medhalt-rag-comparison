Similarly guanethidine competes with noradrenaline at sympathetic nerve endings, but in turn is displaced by amphetamine-like drugs.Many acidic drugs (phenylbutazone, sulfonamides, coumarin anticoagulants, salicylates, &c.) are highly bound to one or two sites on albumin molecules. When the limited carrying capacity of the plasma proteins is filled, any unbound surplus is usually soon metabolized or excreted, so the plasma level becomes restabilized.

These two nephron segments express the water channel aquaporin-1 located along both apical and basolateral membranes. In the proximal tubule, the paracellular pathway accounts for at least 30% of water reabsorption, and the tight-junction core protein claudin-2 plays a key role in this permeability. The ascending limb of Henle and the distal convoluted tubule are impermeant to water and are responsible for urine dilution. In response to AVP, aquaporin-2 water channels stored in subapical intracellular vesicles are translocated to the apical plasma membrane and raise the water permeability of the collecting system. The basolateral step of water reabsorption is mediated by aquaporin-3 and -4, which are constitutively expressed.

In this review, we consider some of the factors that have contributed to this decrease in autopsies, and review the reasons why strong steps should be taken to reverse this trend. When considering the reasons for the decline in autopsies, there can be little doubt that the scandal devolving on inappropriate retention of organs, which came to light in the United Kingdom, but which had reverberations throughout the World, contributed in no small way to the reticence of families to grant appropriate permission to conduct a post-mortem examination. The inappropriate retention of organs came into the public domain in an attempt to emphasise the value of the autopsy in clinical practise, research, and education. All of these good reasons for performing the autopsy remain. From the stance of improving clinical practise, we reiterate that the attitude of the morphologist, working side-by-side with the clinician or surgeon, has always been fundamental in expanding this aspect of knowledge.

However, when the changes in blood pressure in the actively treated group were related to the pretreatment magnesium status, a correlation was found between pretreatment urinary magnesium excretion and the induced change in supine blood pressure (P less than .05) with a blood pressure reduction in subjects with a low pretreatment urinary excretion of magnesium, and a pressor effect in the subjects with the highest pretreatment levels of urinary magnesium. The induced change in blood pressure was furthermore found to be inversely correlated to the changes in serum magnesium and urinary excretion of sodium (P less than .03) induced by treatment indicating that both a direct calcium antagonist action of magnesium at the cellular level as well as a diuretic effect of the increased magnesium load might be involved in the blood pressure effects of magnesium.

Specific therapy is available for several of these infections. Doxycycline is the antimicrobial treatment of choice for all patients, regardless of age, with Rocky Mountain spotted fever, human monocytic ehrlichiosis, or human granulocytic ehrlichiosis. Chloramphenicol has been used to treat these infections in children but is demonstrably inferior to doxycycline. In patients with Mediterranean spotted fever, doxycycline, chloramphenicol, and newer macrolides all appear to be effective therapies. Therapy of Lyme disease depends on the age of the child and stage of the disease. For early localized disease, amoxicillin (for those aged <8 years) or doxycycline (for those aged >/=8 years) is effective. Doxycycline, penicillin V (phenoxymethylpenicillin) or penicillin G (benzylpenicillin) preparations, and erythromycin are all effective treatments for tick-borne relapsing fever. Hospitalized patients with tularemia should receive gentamicin or streptomycin. Doxycycline and ciprofloxacin have each been investigated for the treatment of tularemia in outpatients; however, these agents do not yet have established roles in the treatment of this disease in children. Combination therapy with clindamycin and quinine is preferred for children with babesiosis; the combination of azithromycin and atovaquone also appears promising.

Persistent misconceptions concern the reliability of available diagnostic tools, the signs and symptoms of nervous system involvement, the appropriate choice and duration of antimicrobial therapy, the curability of the infection, and the cause of symptoms that may persist in some patients after treatment. Concern about disparate perspectives led the Institute of Medicine to review the subject.

Cranioneuropathies, in particular palsy of the facial nerve, occur in approximately 3-5% of children with Lyme disease, followed in frequency by meningitis (1% of symptomatic children). Children with only non-specific symptoms such as headache, arthralgia or fatigue commonly are misdiagnosed as having Lyme disease. Although such non-specific symptoms often accompany more specific signs and symptoms (e.g., erythema migrans, arthritis) in children with Lyme disease, very rarely are non-specific symptoms the sole manifestation of Lyme disease.

The most compelling emerging bacterial zoonotic and vector-borne diseases in the United States are Lyme disease; a Southern erythema migrans-like illness; human monocytic ehrlichiosis; human granulocytic ehrlichiosis; a novel cat flea-associated typhus group rickettsiosis; bartonelloses of immunocompetent and immunocompromised persons, particularly with AIDS; and sylvatic plague. Some of these antimicrobial-treatable infections are life threatening. During the acute stage of illness when antimicrobial agents are most effective, the flulike clinical signs and symptoms and available laboratory tests frequently do not point to a particular diagnosis. Epidemiological factors determined by the ecology of the bacteria are often the most useful diagnostic clues. The recognition of these evolving problems emphasizes the need for development of better laboratory diagnostic methods, for surveillance for and tracking of disease, and for continued research into factors contributing to transmission of the organisms. The continual appearance of previously unidentified bacterial infections requires prospective national strategies for timely recognition of the syndrome, identification of the agent, establishment of criteria and methods for diagnosis, optimization of the treatment regimen, and determination of successful approaches to prevention and control.", "source_id": "8627968", "source": "pubmed", "ctv_codes": []}], "validation": {"valid": true, "abstained": false, "issues": [], "warnings": [], "num_citations": 5, "cited_sources": [1, 4, 5, 7, 10]}, "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2257, "completion_tokens": 243, "total_tokens": 5134}, "citations": [1, 4, 5, 7, 10]}

Preeclampsia is, however, not primarily a hypertensive disease but a disorder induced by factors dependent on the presence of placenta. The prime target of the placenta dependent factors is the vascular endothelium. Therefore the complications are associated with the vascular system, i.e. intravascular coagulation, bleeding and organ failure following poor perfusion.
