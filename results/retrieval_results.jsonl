Similarly guanethidine competes with noradrenaline at sympathetic nerve endings, but in turn is displaced by amphetamine-like drugs.Many acidic drugs (phenylbutazone, sulfonamides, coumarin anticoagulants, salicylates, &c.) are highly bound to one or two sites on albumin molecules.

When considering the field of the congenitally malformed heart, it is true that the richness of detail now provided by imaging techniques is truly amazing. Alongside these developments, there has also been a significant decline in the number of autopsies performed in tertiary medial centres around the World. In this review, we consider some of the factors that have contributed to this decrease in autopsies, and review the reasons why strong steps should be taken to reverse this trend. When considering the reasons for the decline in autopsies, there can be little doubt that the scandal devolving on inappropriate retention of organs, which came to light in the United Kingdom, but which had reverberations throughout the World, contributed in no small way to the reticence of families to grant appropriate permission to conduct a post-mortem examination. The inappropriate retention of organs came into the public domain in an attempt to emphasise the value of the autopsy in clinical practise, research, and education. All of these good reasons for performing the autopsy remain. From the stance of improving clinical practise, we reiterate that the attitude of the morphologist, working side-by-side with the clinician or surgeon, has always been fundamental in expanding this aspect of knowledge. We recognise, nonetheless, that performance of the autopsy still carries financial considerations. In this respect, when considering the congenitally malformed heart, we stress the option of having the pathologist working in harness with an experienced cardiac morphologist, or alternatively with a properly trained pathologist's assistant. In terms of training, we show how, with the advantage of a few simple rules, it becomes an easy matter to describe and analyse the congenitally malformed heart. Thereafter, having reviewed means of increasing the number of autopsies, and discussing new techniques, we complete our review with a detailed account of the fetal, perinatal, and paediatric autopsy in the patients with a congenitally malformed heart, taking particular account of the role to be played by the properly trained pathologist's assistant.", "source": "pubmed", "source_id": "18039403", "graph_score": 0.0, "embedding_score": 0.5068265199661255, "combined_score": 0.5068265199661255, "ctv_codes": []}, {"chunk_id": "22546125_chunk_2", "text": "Twenty-four embalmed cadavers were studied in the anatomy laboratory of Case Western Reserve University.", "source": "pubmed", "source_id": "22546125", "graph_score": 0.0, "embedding_score": 0.49851012229919434, "combined_score": 0.49851012229919434, "ctv_codes": []}, {"chunk_id": "15573356_chunk_1", "text": "Other complications are extension of infection laterally to the side of the neck or dissection into the posterior mediastinum through facial planes and the prevertebral space.

For the most part, epidemiological and experimental studies demonstrate an inverse association between magnesium and blood pressure and support a role for magnesium in the pathogenesis of hypertension. However data from clinical studies have been less convincing and the therapeutic value of magnesium in the prevention and management of essential hypertension remains unclear. In view of the still ill-defined role of magnesium in clinical hypertension, magnesium supplementation is advised in those hypertensive patients who are receiving diuretics, who have resistant or secondary hypertension or who have frank magnesium deficiency. A magnesium-rich diet should be encouraged in the prevention of hypertension, particularly in predisposed communities because of the other advantages of such a diet in prevention.

We added 15 mmol Mg to a free diet in 71 subjects with mild essential hypertension or a high-normal blood pressure in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study over 6 months. The treatment, which raised urinary magnesium excretion 30%, induced no general effects on the blood pressure. However, when the changes in blood pressure in the actively treated group were related to the pretreatment magnesium status, a correlation was found between pretreatment urinary magnesium excretion and the induced change in supine blood pressure (P less than .05) with a blood pressure reduction in subjects with a low pretreatment urinary excretion of magnesium, and a pressor effect in the subjects with the highest pretreatment levels of urinary magnesium. The induced change in blood pressure was furthermore found to be inversely correlated to the changes in serum magnesium and urinary excretion of sodium (P less than .03) induced by treatment indicating that both a direct calcium antagonist action of magnesium at the cellular level as well as a diuretic effect of the increased magnesium load might be involved in the blood pressure effects of magnesium. Pretreatment serum potassium concentration also appeared to be a predictor of the induced change in standing blood pressure (P less than .03).

Intracellular magnesium concentration has also been shown to be effective on modulating insulin action (mainly oxidative glucose metabolism), offset calcium-related excitation-contraction coupling, and decrease smooth cell responsiveness to depolarizing stimuli, by stimulating Ca2+-dependent K+ channels. A poor intracellular magnesium concentration, as found in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and in hypertensive (HP) patients, may result in a defective tyrosine-kinase activity at the insulin receptor level and exaggerated intracellular calcium concentration.

Similarly, in HP patients magnesium administration may be useful in decreasing arterial blood pressure and improving insulin-mediated glucose uptake.

When characteristic symptoms of DM are clearly present and blood glucose levels are high enough, the diagnosis is usually unequivocal. However, it is important to remember that the diagnosis is made in asymptomatic patients in most cases, based on the results of routine tests. The prevalence of DM, its specific complications and the presence of other diseases that often accompany DM make this disease one of today's main social and public health problems. The great increase in information available on the etiology and pathophysiology of DM and its chronic complications has led necessarily to the revision of diagnostic criteria and reclassification of the processes involved. Revised diagnostic criteria and classifications were agreed upon in 1997 and 1998 by the American Diabetes Association and the World Health Organization, respectively, and new recommendations were published.

Evidence for heterogeneity is based on measuring endogenous insulin level since some forty years ago. Insulin is lacking at the time of diagnosis in most patients, whose disease started rapidly, with classical symptoms, and who are mainly children, adolescents or young adults. In the majority of middle-aged, obese diabetics, insulin levels are frequently high at diagnosis. Since insulin measuring from sera became a routine laboratory test these two main types were nominated as insulin-dependent, and insulin non-dependent types (IDDM and NIDDM). The aim of the recent classification was, that different diabetic subgroups should be based on etiologic evidence. To avoid confusing nominations, the recent classification recommended to abandon the acronyms, IDDM and NIDDM, and only type-1 and type-2 should be used In the third subgroup-other diabetic groups--there are selected many disorders, whose etiology is mostly clear. As fourth subgroup gestational diabetes preserved its previous place. There are some differential-diagnostic problems in between type-1 and type-2 subgroups, especially between lean body weight type-2 and-the newly discovered latent-onset diabetes in adults (LADA). Diagnostic criteria of diabetes and prediabetic states are being changed according to epidemiological data, because type-2 patients die frequently from cardio-cerebrovascular fatal disorders, and elevated blood sugar values-especially postprandially-contribute to it. Thresholds of blood sugar values for diagnosing diabetes are therefore decreasing, and a new category: impaired fasting glucose (IFG, blood sugar: 6, 1-7.0 mmol/l) was introduced. Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) remained as prediabetic state. Oral glucose loading test in most problematic cases should be carried out. The clinical importance of postprandial hyperglycaemia (postprandial state) is discussed.

Effect of age and diseases on the pharmacokinetics of drugs was a research topic. Acute sotalol intoxications revealed its QT-prolonging properties, and even small mixed overdoses of moclobemide with serotonergic drugs proved fatal. Itraconazole and other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 could drastically increase exposure to drugs like midazolam, triazolam, buspirone, lovastatin, simvastatin and oxycodone, whereas rifampicin greatly reduced their plasma concentrations. A change from potent inhibition to induction caused a 400-fold change in the exposure to oral midazolam. CYP2C8 was revealed to be crucial in the metabolism and interactions of several drugs. Many interactions affecting statins are CYP3A4-mediated, but transporters are important in certain interactions. Tizanidine is very susceptible to CYP1A2 inhibition.

In this, our third exercise in cardiac anatomy, we address the issue of classification of ventricular septal defects. We begin our demonstration by analysing the normal heart. We show that the larger part of the ventricular septum is made up of its muscular component. The membranous part accounts for only a small portion, which is located centrally within the cardiac base. This small membranous part forms a boundary between the right-sided chambers and the aortic root. Holes at this site, therefore, which account for the commonest defects closed surgically, will open centrally in the cardiac base, being located postero-inferiorly relative to the supraventricular crest. We then show that the larger part of the crest itself is a free-standing muscular sleeve, which lifts the leaflets of the pulmonary valve away from the cardiac base. Only a very small part of the muscle forming the right ventricular outlet is located in the septal position. Turning our attention to malformed hearts, we show how holes between the ventricles can open centrally at the cardiac base, open to the inlet or outlet of the right ventricle or open within the substance of the apical muscular septum. We illustrate how it is the phenotypic features, as seen from the right ventricle, which convey the crucial information for the surgeon with regard to the location of the atrioventricular conduction axis, using hearts with holes opening to the inlet of the right ventricle with muscular as opposed to partially fibrous borders to emphasize this point. We continue by showing how holes with different phenotypes can also open to the outlet of the right ventricle, the key feature in this regard being malalignment between the apical muscular septum relative to the muscular outlet septum or its fibrous remnant. Malalignment can also be found between the apical ventricular septum and the atrial septum, this being shown in a defect opening to the inlet of the right ventricle.

Here, we investigate the potential impact of nursing homes on the spread of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens across the healthcare network and its importance for control strategies. METHODS Based on patient transfer data, we designed a network model representing the Dutch healthcare system of hospitals and nursing homes. We simulated the spread of an antimicrobial-resistant pathogen across the healthcare network, and we modeled transmission within institutions using a stochastic susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic model. We identified the contribution of nursing homes to the dispersal of the pathogen by comparing simulations of the network with and without nursing homes. RESULTS Our results strongly suggest that nursing homes in the Netherlands have the potential to drive and sustain epidemics across the healthcare network. Even when the daily probability of transmission in nursing homes is much lower than in hospitals, transmission of resistance can be more effective because of the much longer length of stay of patients in nursing homes. CONCLUSIONS If an antimicrobial-resistant pathogen emerges that spreads easily within nursing homes, control efforts aimed at hospitals may no longer be effective in preventing nationwide outbreaks. It is important to consider nursing homes in planning regional and national infection control and in implementing surveillance systems that monitor the spread of antimicrobial resistance.

The first hypothesis is that SSRIs are more effective than placebo for some types of depression but not for others.

Psychotherapies (cognitive-behavioral and interpersonal therapies) and SSRIs generally have equivalent efficacy, regardless of the severity of depression. The research literature also suggests a third hypothesis that remains to be evaluated: that SSRIs are more effective for treating anxiety disorders (and possibly other disorders) than they are for treating depression.

One important contribution of modeling is to demonstrate that proposed biological mechanisms can be sufficient to account for experimental results. To draw such distinctions, the connection between measurable biological quantities and developmental outcomes must be established. Perhaps the most important task for the future of developmental modeling is to deepen the connection between theory and experiment. Experimentally, this requires detailed and difficult measurements or experimental perturbations of the correlations among inputs and the intracortical connectivity existing during development. Simultaneous measurement of the maps of spatial phase and orientation of mature simple cells will provide important information for the understanding of orientation column development. How will inclusion of additional plasticity mechanisms, such as sprouting and retraction of synapses or plasticity of intracortical connections, alter the analytical understanding thus far achieved? What precisely determines the width of orientation columns in the model presented here? Can the relationship between ocular dominance and orientation columns be understood from developmental rules in a testable way? The existing framework may be extended to a three-dimensional cortex and to more complex models of intracortical connectivity. It may also be applied to other developmental phenomena including the development of lamination in the LGN (Shatz and Stryker, 1988; Hahm et al., 1991), the formation of visual maps in experimentally altered auditory cortex (Roe et al., 1990, 1992), and the mapping of visual and auditory maps in the optic tectum (Knudsen and Brainard, 1991; Brainard and Knudsen, 1993).

By 1886, His had compiled a collection of 12 human embryos of various measured lengths and estimated gestational ages ranging from 2.15 mm to 24 mm, and 2 weeks to 8.5 weeks.

However, despite substantial progress in discovery and early validation, no complement-related biomarker has yet been integrated into routine oncology practice. Key challenges in the field include the biological complexity of the complement system, variability in testing methods, and the lack of standardized protocols for sample collection, processing, and analysis.

Suction procedures (vacuum aspiration, uterine aspiration, or suction curettage) are possible since the decidua are separable from the basal layer of endometrium. This removal by force does not damage other maternal tissue. A cannula is introduced into the uterine cavity through the dilated cervix and its operator is then connected to a pump by way of a flexible tube which delivers negative pressure of about 600 mm of mercury. When the fetus is withdrawn, the uterus is felt to contract onto the cannula. Surgical curettage or dilatation and evacuation first dilates the cervical canal and then removes fetal parts and tissue from ovum forceps; a sharp curette does the rest. Anesthesia for these procedures may be general, local, or spinal. The techniques of menstrual regulation is used before pregnancy can be confirmed.

Traditionally, insulin resistance has been defined in a glucocentric perspective. However, elevated systemic levels of fatty acids are now considered significant contributors towards the pathophysiological aspects associated with the syndrome. An overaccumulation of unoxidized long-chain fatty acids can saturate the storage capacity of adipose tissue, resulting in a lipid 'spill over' to non-adipose tissues, such as the liver, muscle, heart, and pancreatic-islets. Under these circumstances, such ectopic lipid deposition can have deleterious effects. The excess lipids are driven into alternative non-oxidative pathways, which result in the formation of reactive lipid moieties that promote metabolically relevant cellular dysfunction (lipotoxicity) and programmed cell-death (lipoapoptosis).

Obesity, especially abdominal obesity, is an important determinant of the risk of developing insulin resistance and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. It is suggested that a high proportion of fat in the diet is associated with impaired insulin sensitivity and an increased risk of developing diabetes, independent of obesity and body fat localization, and that this risk may be influenced by the type of fatty acids in the diet. Cross-sectional studies show significant relationships between the serum lipid fatty acid composition, which at least partly mirrors the quality of the fatty acids in the diet, and insulin sensitivity. Insulin resistance, and disorders characterized by insulin resistance, are associated with a specific fatty acid pattern of the serum lipids with increased proportions of palmitic (16:0) and palmitoleic acids (16:1 n-7) and reduced levels of linoleic acid (18:2 n-6). The metabolism of linoleic acid seems to be disturbed with increased proportions of dihomo-gamma linolenic acid (20:3 n-6) and a reduced activity of the delta 5 desaturase, while the activities of the delta 9 and delta 6 desaturases appear to be increased. The skeletal muscle is the main determinant of insulin sensitivity. Several studies have shown that the fatty acid composition of the phosholipids of the skeletal muscle cell membranes is closely related to insulin sensitivity. An increased saturation of the membrane fatty acids and a reduced activity of delta 5 desaturase have been associated with insulin resistance. The fatty acid composition of the lipids in serum and muscle is influenced by diet, but also by the degree of physical activity, genetic disposition, and possibly fetal undernutrition.

Potential mechanisms for this association include apparent defects in fatty acid metabolism that are centered at the mitochondria in obesity and in type 2 diabetes. Specifically, defects in the pathways for fatty acid oxidation during postabsorptive conditions are prominent, leading to diminished use of fatty acids and increased esterification and storage of lipid within skeletal muscle. These impairments in fatty acid metabolism during fasting conditions may be related to a metabolic inflexibility in insulin resistance that is not limited to defects in glucose metabolism during insulin-stimulated conditions. Thus, there is substantial evidence implicating perturbations in fatty acid metabolism during accumulation of skeletal muscle triglyceride and in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. Weight loss by caloric restriction improves insulin sensitivity, but the effects on fatty acid metabolism are less conspicuous. Nevertheless, weight loss decreases the content of triglyceride within skeletal muscle, perhaps contributing to the improvement in Insulin action with weight loss.

Mentions of pharyngotomy operations were found in the papyrus called Ebers's Papyrus dating back to about 1550 BC, which can obviously be treated as an encyclopaedia of the medical knowledge that the ancient Egyptians possessed. Guidelines for the person performing pharyngotomy were described in Rig Veda - the holy scriptures of Hindi medicine, about 2000 BC. Asclepiads of Prussia in Bithynia (124-156 BC), a Greek physician practising in Rome, is commonly considered the father of pharyngotomy. In the 1st century BC he documented an operation similar to pharyngotomy. Procedures similar to pharyngotomy were conducted by Claudius Galenus of Pergamon (about 130-200 AD) who was treating gladiators at the beginning of his medical career. A precise description of the technique in pharyngotomy performed by the method adopted from Antilla (3rd century AD) was presented by Paulos Aeginata (625-690 AD), whereas in modern times the first surgical pharyngotomy was performed by Antonio Brasavola (1490-1554) in 1546. In those times pharyngotomy operations were applied as life saving procedures and were associated with a desperate fight for life. All the experiences connected with the pharyngotomy technique were collected by Lorenz Heister (1683-1758) and published in his work \"Surgery\" in 1716. Until the end of 18th century the work finally established views about performing pharyngotomy operations. In 1856 Eugeniusz Bonchut conducted the first pharyngotomy in a child with passing an intubation tube into the trachea lumen. The operation was performed according to theoretical assumptions by Armando Trausseau (1801-1867), whose contributions to emergency pharyngotomy methods are enormous. Finally, at the beginning of the 20th century Chevalier Jackson (1865-1958) set principles for surgical techniques in pharyngotomy that still remain in force. The return to Sanctorius's method and also adaptation of Selinger's method (1953) of cannulation of blood vessels turned out to be fundamental for the further development of transdermal pharyngotomy. The first set for multistage, dilatation pharyngotomy was provided by P. Ciaglia et al. A one-stage pharyngotomy by special forceps was described by W. M. Griggs et al. A technique of transdermal pharyngotomy from inside the trachea was presented in 1995 by A. Fantoni with his group.

Classical pharmacological actions in vivo have been reported with dilutions as high as 10(-22)mol/L, but homeopathic medicines may be far more dilute than this. There is growing biological evidence including independent reproduction that in vivo effects may occur at such dilutions. In a systematic review, 73% of experiments showed an effect with ultramolecular dilutions including 68% of high-quality experiments. Physical and physico-chemical work suggests that homeopathic preparations contain stable ordered supramolecular structures, gas nanobubbles and dissolved silicates may be involved. Homeopathy may contribute to the generalizability and reproducibility of hormesis effects. It also raises the question of the threshold of hormesis effects.", "source": "pubmed", "source_id": "20558606", "graph_score": 0.0, "embedding_score": 0.36770424246788025, "combined_score": 0.36770424246788025, "ctv_codes": []}, {"chunk_id": "1892610_chunk_0", "text": "As a follow-up to a previous article, where the characteristics of the solid state and the X-ray properties and pharmaceutical applications were described (\"X-rays, diffractometry in the analysis of drugs and pharmaceutical forms\", Boll.

Human papillomavirus, human immunodeficiency virus, herpes virus, and hepatitis B virus were identified as cancer-causing viruses. Several laboratory tests were developed for the detection of primary and recurrent cancers, and cancer prevention by screening methods was popularized.

We believe that there are only three options for hydrodynamic pressure elevation in a mechanical model of the cardiovascular system: 1) a decrease in the volume of the arterial bed at a constant volume of intravascular fluid; 2) an increase in the volume of intravascular fluid at a constant volume of the vascular bed; and 3) increased blood flow resistance at constant volumes of the vascular bed and intravascular fluid. The third option can be linked to all forms of increased peripheral blood flow resistance in the arterial bed occurring in coarctation of the aorta, renovascular hypertension, impaired flow (endothelium)-dependent vasodilation and moderate spasm of muscular arterioles, arterial wall lesion in atherosclerosis, atheromatosis and atherothrombosis, Takayasu syndrome, and obliterating endarteritis. Elevation of BP in erythemia, under the effect of leukocyte colony-stimulating factor and after injection of a recombinant erythropoietin can also be regarded within the frames of the third option.

Blood-derived therapies conventionally used for management of affected infants with genetic/acquired deficiencies, bleeding problems (coagulation Factor reduced or missing) or thrombotic disorders (reduced or missing anticoagulant proteins) pose some additional risks. The introduction of recombinant proteins has allowed manufacturers to produce large amounts of the proteins usually present at very low concentration in blood.

An assessment of the ICH's claims about the implications of 'technical' harmonization of drug-testing standards for the maintenance of drug safety, via toxicological testing, and the delivery of therapeutic progress, via innovation, is presented. By demonstrating that there is not a technoscientific validity for these claims, it is argued that, within the ICH, a discourse of technological innovation and scientific progress has been used by regulatory agencies and prominent parts of the transnational pharmaceutical industry to legitimize the lowering and loosening of toxicological standards for drug testing. The mobilization and acceptance of this discourse are shown to be pivotal to the ICH's transformation of reductions in safety standards, which are apparently against the interests of patients and public health, into supposed therapeutic benefits derived from promises of greater access to more innovative drug products.

As accounts of its captivating manifestations grew, anosognosia was established as a prominent symbol of neurological and psychic disturbance accompanying (right-hemisphere) stroke.

The theoretical advantages of these nylon fabrics over presently available silver compounds is their ability to continuously release silver ions into the burn wound as long as the material is in contact with the wound. Additionally, the release of silver from these fabrics can be augmented electrolytically. The results of these experiments indicated that both materials were microbicidal in vitro for all three test organisms. Furthermore, the antimicrobial activity could be significantly augmented by passing a weak DC current through the material, which increased the rate of release of silver ions from the fabrics.

In this, our third exercise in cardiac anatomy, we address the issue of classification of ventricular septal defects. We begin our demonstration by analysing the normal heart. We show that the larger part of the ventricular septum is made up of its muscular component. The membranous part accounts for only a small portion, which is located centrally within the cardiac base. This small membranous part forms a boundary between the right-sided chambers and the aortic root. Holes at this site, therefore, which account for the commonest defects closed surgically, will open centrally in the cardiac base, being located postero-inferiorly relative to the supraventricular crest. We then show that the larger part of the crest itself is a free-standing muscular sleeve, which lifts the leaflets of the pulmonary valve away from the cardiac base. Only a very small part of the muscle forming the right ventricular outlet is located in the septal position. Turning our attention to malformed hearts, we show how holes between the ventricles can open centrally at the cardiac base, open to the inlet or outlet of the right ventricle or open within the substance of the apical muscular septum. We illustrate how it is the phenotypic features, as seen from the right ventricle, which convey the crucial information for the surgeon with regard to the location of the atrioventricular conduction axis, using hearts with holes opening to the inlet of the right ventricle with muscular as opposed to partially fibrous borders to emphasize this point. We continue by showing how holes with different phenotypes can also open to the outlet of the right ventricle, the key feature in this regard being malalignment between the apical muscular septum relative to the muscular outlet septum or its fibrous remnant. Malalignment can also be found between the apical ventricular septum and the atrial septum, this being shown in a defect opening to the inlet of the right ventricle.

Filling problems due to powder flooding could be solved by increasing the powder bed height in the powder bowl. The fact that such powders usually do not form a firm plug was not reflected in the coefficient of fill weight variation, and uniform filling could hence be achieved without problems. The influence of the powder bed height on the capsule fill weight increased with decreasing powder flow. The influence of the setting of the tamping pins on the capsule fill weight was comparatively small and further decreased with a decrease in powder flow. However, when a granulated product (Elcema G250) was filled, the tamping pin setting was more important than the influence of the powder bed height on the capsule fill weight. For moderate flowing powders the coefficient of fill weight variation appeared to be nearly independent of powder bed height or tamping pin setting.

Of 2984 identified references, 26 articles based on 25 unique studies met our inclusion criteria, which involved a total of 28,382 participants. The five studies that assessed global DNA methylation generally found lower methylation levels with higher systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and/or presence of hypertension. Eighteen candidate-gene studies reported, in total, 16 differentially methylated genes, including renin-angiotensin-system-related genes (ACE promoter and AGTR1) and genes involved in sodium homeostasis and extracellular fluid volume maintenance system (NET promoter, SCNN1A, and ADD1). Between the three identified epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS), lower methylation levels of SULF1, EHMT2, and SKOR2 were found in hypertensive patients as compared with normotensive subjects, and lower methylation levels of PHGDH, SLC7A11, and TSPAN2 were associated with higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure. In summary, the most convincing evidence has been reported from candidate-gene studies, which show reproducible epigenetic changes in the interconnected renin-angiotensin and inflammatory systems. Our study highlights gaps in the literature on the role of histone modifications in blood pressure and the need to conduct high-quality studies, in particular, hypothesis-generating studies that may help to elucidate new molecular mechanisms.", "source": "pubmed", "source_id": "31346255", "graph_score": 0.0, "embedding_score": 0.4536218047142029, "combined_score": 0.4536218047142029, "ctv_codes": []}, {"chunk_id": "28401680_chunk_0", "text": "Although the factors responsible for the recent increase in the prevalence of diabetes worldwide are not entirely known, the morbidity associated with this disease results in substantial health and economic burden on society. Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation have been identified as one mechanism by which the environment interacts with the genome and there is evidence that alterations in DNA methylation may contribute to the increased prevalence of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. This review provides a summary of DNA methylation and its role in gene regulation, and includes descriptions of various techniques to measure site-specific and genome-wide DNA methylation changes. In addition, we review current literature highlighting the complex relationship between DNA methylation, gene expression, and the development of diabetes and related complications. In studies where both DNA methylation and gene expression changes were reported, DNA methylation status had a strong inverse correlation with gene expression, suggesting that this interaction may be a potential future therapeutic target. We highlight the emerging use of genome-wide DNA methylation profiles as a biomarker to predict patients at risk of developing diabetes or specific complications of diabetes.
