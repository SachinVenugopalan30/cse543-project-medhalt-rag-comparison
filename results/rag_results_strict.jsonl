The bound drug, often a high proportion of the total, acts as a reservoir, preventing wild fluctuations between ineffective and toxic levels of the biologically active unbound fraction.Displacement from a receptor site diminishes drug activity, but displacement from plasma or tissue proteins augments the effect by making more unbound drug available at the receptor site.Atropine has no intrinsic activity, but displaces acetylcholine or pilocarpine from receptors at para-sympathetic nerve endings. Similarly guanethidine competes with noradrenaline at sympathetic nerve endings, but in turn is displaced by amphetamine-like drugs.Many acidic drugs (phenylbutazone, sulfonamides, coumarin anticoagulants, salicylates, &c.) are highly bound to one or two sites on albumin molecules. When the limited carrying capacity of the plasma proteins is filled, any unbound surplus is usually soon metabolized or excreted, so the plasma level becomes restabilized.

These two nephron segments express the water channel aquaporin-1 located along both apical and basolateral membranes. In the proximal tubule, the paracellular pathway accounts for at least 30% of water reabsorption, and the tight-junction core protein claudin-2 plays a key role in this permeability. The ascending limb of Henle and the distal convoluted tubule are impermeant to water and are responsible for urine dilution. In response to AVP, aquaporin-2 water channels stored in subapical intracellular vesicles are translocated to the apical plasma membrane and raise the water permeability of the collecting system.

In this review, we consider some of the factors that have contributed to this decrease in autopsies, and review the reasons why strong steps should be taken to reverse this trend. When considering the reasons for the decline in autopsies, there can be little doubt that the scandal devolving on inappropriate retention of organs, which came to light in the United Kingdom, but which had reverberations throughout the World, contributed in no small way to the reticence of families to grant appropriate permission to conduct a post-mortem examination. The inappropriate retention of organs came into the public domain in an attempt to emphasise the value of the autopsy in clinical practise, research, and education. All of these good reasons for performing the autopsy remain. From the stance of improving clinical practise, we reiterate that the attitude of the morphologist, working side-by-side with the clinician or surgeon, has always been fundamental in expanding this aspect of knowledge.

The treatment, which raised urinary magnesium excretion 30%, induced no general effects on the blood pressure. However, when the changes in blood pressure in the actively treated group were related to the pretreatment magnesium status, a correlation was found between pretreatment urinary magnesium excretion and the induced change in supine blood pressure (P less than .05) with a blood pressure reduction in subjects with a low pretreatment urinary excretion of magnesium, and a pressor effect in the subjects with the highest pretreatment levels of urinary magnesium. The induced change in blood pressure was furthermore found to be inversely correlated to the changes in serum magnesium and urinary excretion of sodium (P less than .03) induced by treatment indicating that both a direct calcium antagonist action of magnesium at the cellular level as well as a diuretic effect of the increased magnesium load might be involved in the blood pressure effects of magnesium. Pretreatment serum potassium concentration also appeared to be a predictor of the induced change in standing blood pressure (P less than .03).

A poor intracellular magnesium concentration, as found in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and in hypertensive (HP) patients, may result in a defective tyrosine-kinase activity at the insulin receptor level and exaggerated intracellular calcium concentration.

The recognition of these evolving problems emphasizes the need for development of better laboratory diagnostic methods, for surveillance for and tracking of disease, and for continued research into factors contributing to transmission of the organisms.

The origin and etiology of DM can vary greatly but always include defects in either insulin secretion or response or in both at some point in the course of disease. When characteristic symptoms of DM are clearly present and blood glucose levels are high enough, the diagnosis is usually unequivocal. However, it is important to remember that the diagnosis is made in asymptomatic patients in most cases, based on the results of routine tests. The prevalence of DM, its specific complications and the presence of other diseases that often accompany DM make this disease one of today's main social and public health problems. The great increase in information available on the etiology and pathophysiology of DM and its chronic complications has led necessarily to the revision of diagnostic criteria and reclassification of the processes involved. Revised diagnostic criteria and classifications were agreed upon in 1997 and 1998 by the American Diabetes Association and the World Health Organization, respectively, and new recommendations were published. Thanks to cross-representation on the committees, the conclusions and final recommendations are, in general, very similar, although a few minor differences are present.

Evidence for heterogeneity is based on measuring endogenous insulin level since some forty years ago. Insulin is lacking at the time of diagnosis in most patients, whose disease started rapidly, with classical symptoms, and who are mainly children, adolescents or young adults. In the majority of middle-aged, obese diabetics, insulin levels are frequently high at diagnosis. Since insulin measuring from sera became a routine laboratory test these two main types were nominated as insulin-dependent, and insulin non-dependent types (IDDM and NIDDM). The aim of the recent classification was, that different diabetic subgroups should be based on etiologic evidence. To avoid confusing nominations, the recent classification recommended to abandon the acronyms, IDDM and NIDDM, and only type-1 and type-2 should be used In the third subgroup-other diabetic groups--there are selected many disorders, whose etiology is mostly clear. As fourth subgroup gestational diabetes preserved its previous place. There are some differential-diagnostic problems in between type-1 and type-2 subgroups, especially between lean body weight type-2 and-the newly discovered latent-onset diabetes in adults (LADA). Diagnostic criteria of diabetes and prediabetic states are being changed according to epidemiological data, because type-2 patients die frequently from cardio-cerebrovascular fatal disorders, and elevated blood sugar values-especially postprandially-contribute to it. Thresholds of blood sugar values for diagnosing diabetes are therefore decreasing, and a new category: impaired fasting glucose (IFG, blood sugar: 6, 1-7.0 mmol/l) was introduced. Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) remained as prediabetic state. Oral glucose loading test in most problematic cases should be carried out. The clinical importance of postprandial hyperglycaemia (postprandial state) is discussed. As a new clinical concept, the Metabolic Syndrome seems to replace type-2 diabetes in the majority of these patients, even in the impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) state.

Effect of age and diseases on the pharmacokinetics of drugs was a research topic. Acute sotalol intoxications revealed its QT-prolonging properties, and even small mixed overdoses of moclobemide with serotonergic drugs proved fatal. Itraconazole and other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 could drastically increase exposure to drugs like midazolam, triazolam, buspirone, lovastatin, simvastatin and oxycodone, whereas rifampicin greatly reduced their plasma concentrations. A change from potent inhibition to induction caused a 400-fold change in the exposure to oral midazolam. CYP2C8 was revealed to be crucial in the metabolism and interactions of several drugs. Many interactions affecting statins are CYP3A4-mediated, but transporters are important in certain interactions. Tizanidine is very susceptible to CYP1A2 inhibition.

We show that the larger part of the ventricular septum is made up of its muscular component. The membranous part accounts for only a small portion, which is located centrally within the cardiac base. This small membranous part forms a boundary between the right-sided chambers and the aortic root. Holes at this site, therefore, which account for the commonest defects closed surgically, will open centrally in the cardiac base, being located postero-inferiorly relative to the supraventricular crest. We then show that the larger part of the crest itself is a free-standing muscular sleeve, which lifts the leaflets of the pulmonary valve away from the cardiac base. Only a very small part of the muscle forming the right ventricular outlet is located in the septal position. Turning our attention to malformed hearts, we show how holes between the ventricles can open centrally at the cardiac base, open to the inlet or outlet of the right ventricle or open within the substance of the apical muscular septum. We illustrate how it is the phenotypic features, as seen from the right ventricle, which convey the crucial information for the surgeon with regard to the location of the atrioventricular conduction axis, using hearts with holes opening to the inlet of the right ventricle with muscular as opposed to partially fibrous borders to emphasize this point. We continue by showing how holes with different phenotypes can also open to the outlet of the right ventricle, the key feature in this regard being malalignment between the apical muscular septum relative to the muscular outlet septum or its fibrous remnant.

Here, we investigate the potential impact of nursing homes on the spread of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens across the healthcare network and its importance for control strategies. METHODS Based on patient transfer data, we designed a network model representing the Dutch healthcare system of hospitals and nursing homes. We simulated the spread of an antimicrobial-resistant pathogen across the healthcare network, and we modeled transmission within institutions using a stochastic susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic model. We identified the contribution of nursing homes to the dispersal of the pathogen by comparing simulations of the network with and without nursing homes. RESULTS Our results strongly suggest that nursing homes in the Netherlands have the potential to drive and sustain epidemics across the healthcare network. Even when the daily probability of transmission in nursing homes is much lower than in hospitals, transmission of resistance can be more effective because of the much longer length of stay of patients in nursing homes. CONCLUSIONS If an antimicrobial-resistant pathogen emerges that spreads easily within nursing homes, control efforts aimed at hospitals may no longer be effective in preventing nationwide outbreaks.

Psychotherapies (cognitive-behavioral and interpersonal therapies) and SSRIs generally have equivalent efficacy, regardless of the severity of depression.

Alterations in Ca2+ handling by the vascular smooth muscle cells seem to underlie these disorders. Alveolar hypoxia also constricts pulmonary arteries, increasing the intracellular Ca2+ availability for smooth muscle contraction. This suggests the hypothesis that hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction depends on similar biochemical disorders, and that the response to the hypoxic stimulus may be emphasized in high blood pressure. In 21 hypertensive and 10 normotensive men, pulmonary arterial pressure and arteriolar resistance have been evaluated during air respiration and after 15 min of breathing 17, 15 and 12% oxygen in nitrogen. Curves relating changes in pulmonary arterial pressure and arteriolar resistance to the oxygen content of inspired gas had a similar configuration in the two populations, but in hypertension were steeper and significantly shifted to the left of those in normotension, reflecting a lower threshold and an enhanced vasoconstrictor reactivity. This pattern was not related to differences in severity of the hypoxic stimulus, degree of hypocapnia and respiratory alkalosis induced by hypoxia, and plasma catecholamines.

One important contribution of modeling is to demonstrate that proposed biological mechanisms can be sufficient to account for experimental results. To draw such distinctions, the connection between measurable biological quantities and developmental outcomes must be established. Perhaps the most important task for the future of developmental modeling is to deepen the connection between theory and experiment. Experimentally, this requires detailed and difficult measurements or experimental perturbations of the correlations among inputs and the intracortical connectivity existing during development. Simultaneous measurement of the maps of spatial phase and orientation of mature simple cells will provide important information for the understanding of orientation column development. How will inclusion of additional plasticity mechanisms, such as sprouting and retraction of synapses or plasticity of intracortical connections, alter the analytical understanding thus far achieved? What precisely determines the width of orientation columns in the model presented here? Can the relationship between ocular dominance and orientation columns be understood from developmental rules in a testable way? The existing framework may be extended to a three-dimensional cortex and to more complex models of intracortical connectivity. It may also be applied to other developmental phenomena including the development of lamination in the LGN (Shatz and Stryker, 1988; Hahm et al., 1991), the formation of visual maps in experimentally altered auditory cortex (Roe et al., 1990, 1992), and the mapping of visual and auditory maps in the optic tectum (Knudsen and Brainard, 1991; Brainard and Knudsen, 1993). For each system the goal is to develop testable predictions as to the patterns of activity and connectivity that could or could not lead to the results observed given a proposed mechanism of plasticity. Incorporation of deeper levels of biophysical realism will extend, deepen, and perhaps fundamentally alter the framework presented here. An important goal for the future will be to understand the computational and functional significance of developmental rules. Activity-dependent, competitive mechanisms of synaptic plasticity appear to play an important role in many processes of late neural development, where an initially rough connectivity pattern refines to a precise, mature pattern.

Obesity, especially abdominal obesity, is an important determinant of the risk of developing insulin resistance and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. It is suggested that a high proportion of fat in the diet is associated with impaired insulin sensitivity and an increased risk of developing diabetes, independent of obesity and body fat localization, and that this risk may be influenced by the type of fatty acids in the diet. Cross-sectional studies show significant relationships between the serum lipid fatty acid composition, which at least partly mirrors the quality of the fatty acids in the diet, and insulin sensitivity. Insulin resistance, and disorders characterized by insulin resistance, are associated with a specific fatty acid pattern of the serum lipids with increased proportions of palmitic (16:0) and palmitoleic acids (16:1 n-7) and reduced levels of linoleic acid (18:2 n-6). The metabolism of linoleic acid seems to be disturbed with increased proportions of dihomo-gamma linolenic acid (20:3 n-6) and a reduced activity of the delta 5 desaturase, while the activities of the delta 9 and delta 6 desaturases appear to be increased. The skeletal muscle is the main determinant of insulin sensitivity. Several studies have shown that the fatty acid composition of the phosholipids of the skeletal muscle cell membranes is closely related to insulin sensitivity. An increased saturation of the membrane fatty acids and a reduced activity of delta 5 desaturase have been associated with insulin resistance. The fatty acid composition of the lipids in serum and muscle is influenced by diet, but also by the degree of physical activity, genetic disposition, and possibly fetal undernutrition.

Potential mechanisms for this association include apparent defects in fatty acid metabolism that are centered at the mitochondria in obesity and in type 2 diabetes. Specifically, defects in the pathways for fatty acid oxidation during postabsorptive conditions are prominent, leading to diminished use of fatty acids and increased esterification and storage of lipid within skeletal muscle. These impairments in fatty acid metabolism during fasting conditions may be related to a metabolic inflexibility in insulin resistance that is not limited to defects in glucose metabolism during insulin-stimulated conditions. Thus, there is substantial evidence implicating perturbations in fatty acid metabolism during accumulation of skeletal muscle triglyceride and in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. Weight loss by caloric restriction improves insulin sensitivity, but the effects on fatty acid metabolism are less conspicuous. Nevertheless, weight loss decreases the content of triglyceride within skeletal muscle, perhaps contributing to the improvement in Insulin action with weight loss.

Knowledge accumulated over the past two decades has demonstrated that these anions can be recycled back to NO and other bioactive nitrogen oxides via serial reductions that involve oral commensal bacteria and various enzymatic systems. Intake of inorganic nitrate, which is predominantly found in green leafy vegetables and beets, has a variety of favourable cardiovascular effects. As hypertension is a major risk factor of morbidity and mortality worldwide, much attention has been paid to the blood pressure reducing effect of inorganic nitrate. Here, we describe how dietary nitrate, via stimulation of the nitrate-nitrite-NO pathway, affects various organ systems and discuss underlying mechanisms that may contribute to the observed blood pressure-lowering effect.", "source_id": "29694703", "source": "pubmed", "ctv_codes": []}, {"text": "However, a central problem in the biochemical sciences is that the functions of only a fraction of the genes/proteins are known, and this is also an issue in pharmacology. This review is focused on issues related to the functions of cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes. P450 functions can be categorized in several groups: 1) Some P450s have critical roles in the metabolism of endogenous substrates (e.g., sterols and fat-soluble vitamins). 2) Some P450s are not generally critical to normal physiology but function in relatively nonselective protection from the many xenobiotic chemicals to which mammals (including humans) are exposed in their diets [as well as more anthropomorphic chemicals (e.g., drugs, pesticides)]. 3) Some P450s have not been extensively studied and are termed \"orphans\" here. With regard to elucidation of any physiological functions of the orphan P450s, the major subject of this review, it is clear that simple trial-and-error approaches with individual substrate candidates will not be very productive in addressing questions about function. A series of liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/informatics approaches are discussed, along with some successes with both human and bacterial P450s.

Guidelines for the person performing pharyngotomy were described in Rig Veda - the holy scriptures of Hindi medicine, about 2000 BC. Asclepiads of Prussia in Bithynia (124-156 BC), a Greek physician practising in Rome, is commonly considered the father of pharyngotomy. In the 1st century BC he documented an operation similar to pharyngotomy. Procedures similar to pharyngotomy were conducted by Claudius Galenus of Pergamon (about 130-200 AD) who was treating gladiators at the beginning of his medical career. A precise description of the technique in pharyngotomy performed by the method adopted from Antilla (3rd century AD) was presented by Paulos Aeginata (625-690 AD), whereas in modern times the first surgical pharyngotomy was performed by Antonio Brasavola (1490-1554) in 1546. In those times pharyngotomy operations were applied as life saving procedures and were associated with a desperate fight for life. All the experiences connected with the pharyngotomy technique were collected by Lorenz Heister (1683-1758) and published in his work \"Surgery\" in 1716. Until the end of 18th century the work finally established views about performing pharyngotomy operations. In 1856 Eugeniusz Bonchut conducted the first pharyngotomy in a child with passing an intubation tube into the trachea lumen. The operation was performed according to theoretical assumptions by Armando Trausseau (1801-1867), whose contributions to emergency pharyngotomy methods are enormous. Finally, at the beginning of the 20th century Chevalier Jackson (1865-1958) set principles for surgical techniques in pharyngotomy that still remain in force. The return to Sanctorius's method and also adaptation of Selinger's method (1953) of cannulation of blood vessels turned out to be fundamental for the further development of transdermal pharyngotomy. The first set for multistage, dilatation pharyngotomy was provided by P. Ciaglia et al. A one-stage pharyngotomy by special forceps was described by W. M. Griggs et al.

The introduction of recombinant proteins has allowed manufacturers to produce large amounts of the proteins usually present at very low concentration in blood.

Artificial sebum that consisted of 10 lipids at proportions that closely resembled human sebum was characterized using thin layer chromatography under a variety of storage and use conditions (dry and liquid, 4\u00b0C and 32\u00b0C, with and without vitamin E) for 28 days. Levels of sebum constituents maintained in solution and dry at 4\u00b0C were stable through the duration of the test period.

An assessment of the ICH's claims about the implications of 'technical' harmonization of drug-testing standards for the maintenance of drug safety, via toxicological testing, and the delivery of therapeutic progress, via innovation, is presented. By demonstrating that there is not a technoscientific validity for these claims, it is argued that, within the ICH, a discourse of technological innovation and scientific progress has been used by regulatory agencies and prominent parts of the transnational pharmaceutical industry to legitimize the lowering and loosening of toxicological standards for drug testing. The mobilization and acceptance of this discourse are shown to be pivotal to the ICH's transformation of reductions in safety standards, which are apparently against the interests of patients and public health, into supposed therapeutic benefits derived from promises of greater access to more innovative drug products.

In this, our third exercise in cardiac anatomy, we address the issue of classification of ventricular septal defects. We begin our demonstration by analysing the normal heart. We show that the larger part of the ventricular septum is made up of its muscular component. The membranous part accounts for only a small portion, which is located centrally within the cardiac base. This small membranous part forms a boundary between the right-sided chambers and the aortic root. Holes at this site, therefore, which account for the commonest defects closed surgically, will open centrally in the cardiac base, being located postero-inferiorly relative to the supraventricular crest. We then show that the larger part of the crest itself is a free-standing muscular sleeve, which lifts the leaflets of the pulmonary valve away from the cardiac base. Only a very small part of the muscle forming the right ventricular outlet is located in the septal position. Turning our attention to malformed hearts, we show how holes between the ventricles can open centrally at the cardiac base, open to the inlet or outlet of the right ventricle or open within the substance of the apical muscular septum. We illustrate how it is the phenotypic features, as seen from the right ventricle, which convey the crucial information for the surgeon with regard to the location of the atrioventricular conduction axis, using hearts with holes opening to the inlet of the right ventricle with muscular as opposed to partially fibrous borders to emphasize this point. We continue by showing how holes with different phenotypes can also open to the outlet of the right ventricle, the key feature in this regard being malalignment between the apical muscular septum relative to the muscular outlet septum or its fibrous remnant. Malalignment can also be found between the apical ventricular septum and the atrial septum, this being shown in a defect opening to the inlet of the right ventricle.

Such shortcomings include limited antibiotic release, incompatibility with many antimicrobial agents, and the need for follow-up surgeries to remove the non-biodegradable cement before surgical reconstruction of the lost bone.

Filling problems due to powder flooding could be solved by increasing the powder bed height in the powder bowl. The fact that such powders usually do not form a firm plug was not reflected in the coefficient of fill weight variation, and uniform filling could hence be achieved without problems. The influence of the powder bed height on the capsule fill weight increased with decreasing powder flow. The influence of the setting of the tamping pins on the capsule fill weight was comparatively small and further decreased with a decrease in powder flow. However, when a granulated product (Elcema G250) was filled, the tamping pin setting was more important than the influence of the powder bed height on the capsule fill weight. For moderate flowing powders the coefficient of fill weight variation appeared to be nearly independent of powder bed height or tamping pin setting.

We suppose that cell mediated immunity (CMI) to insulin plays the central role in the diabetes genesis. Autoimmune process may be triggered by viruses family Paramyxoviridae, in 10-20% of type 1 diabetes patients the disease is a consequence of direct cytotoxic effect of other viruses to the islet cells of pancreas. In acute phase of viral infection (measles, mumps, parainfluenza) CMI against viruses is developed, in some patients CMI to insulin appeared. We suppose that autoimmune reactions in these cases are the result of cross reaction between viral antigens and insulin. The majorities of patients suppress these reactions and recover from acute infection diseases with the antiviral immunity development and without any complications. Other patients are not able to suppress autoimmune reactions to insulin and pathological process is triggered. Type 1A diabetes is a result of direct CMI to insulin, and this process is responsible for beta-cells destruction; may be type 1B DM is due to the direct cytotoxic effect of other viruses or toxins to them. Some patients with acute viral infection cannot destroy the aggressive clone and they suppress autoimmune reaction to insulin by prostaglandin synthesizing cells (PGSC) or \u0441ells with histamine receptors (CHR). As a result of this process the insulin resistance is developed, because these cells or their cytokines form a block to the insulin receptors not only on immunocompetent cells, but in insulin sensitive tissues too. Patients with different reactions to insulin have different courses and outcomes of DM. We suppose that CMI to insulin is acceptable criterion for differentiation of DM, for identifying high risk group of patients in whom DM or its complications may develop. Moreover, prophylactic measures for decreasing of insulin resistance by nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs or histamine H(2) receptor antagonists in persons with high activity of PGSC or CHR respectively can give good results.
