The bound drug, often a high proportion of the total, acts as a reservoir, preventing wild fluctuations between ineffective and toxic levels of the biologically active unbound fraction.Displacement from a receptor site diminishes drug activity, but displacement from plasma or tissue proteins augments the effect by making more unbound drug available at the receptor site.Atropine has no intrinsic activity, but displaces acetylcholine or pilocarpine from receptors at para-sympathetic nerve endings. Similarly guanethidine competes with noradrenaline at sympathetic nerve endings, but in turn is displaced by amphetamine-like drugs.Many acidic drugs (phenylbutazone, sulfonamides, coumarin anticoagulants, salicylates, &c.) are highly bound to one or two sites on albumin molecules. When the limited carrying capacity of the plasma proteins is filled, any unbound surplus is usually soon metabolized or excreted, so the plasma level becomes restabilized.

These two nephron segments express the water channel aquaporin-1 located along both apical and basolateral membranes. In the proximal tubule, the paracellular pathway accounts for at least 30% of water reabsorption, and the tight-junction core protein claudin-2 plays a key role in this permeability. The ascending limb of Henle and the distal convoluted tubule are impermeant to water and are responsible for urine dilution. In response to AVP, aquaporin-2 water channels stored in subapical intracellular vesicles are translocated to the apical plasma membrane and raise the water permeability of the collecting system.

In this review, we consider some of the factors that have contributed to this decrease in autopsies, and review the reasons why strong steps should be taken to reverse this trend. When considering the reasons for the decline in autopsies, there can be little doubt that the scandal devolving on inappropriate retention of organs, which came to light in the United Kingdom, but which had reverberations throughout the World, contributed in no small way to the reticence of families to grant appropriate permission to conduct a post-mortem examination. The inappropriate retention of organs came into the public domain in an attempt to emphasise the value of the autopsy in clinical practise, research, and education. All of these good reasons for performing the autopsy remain. From the stance of improving clinical practise, we reiterate that the attitude of the morphologist, working side-by-side with the clinician or surgeon, has always been fundamental in expanding this aspect of knowledge. We recognise, nonetheless, that performance of the autopsy still carries financial considerations.

In view of the still ill-defined role of magnesium in clinical hypertension, magnesium supplementation is advised in those hypertensive patients who are receiving diuretics, who have resistant or secondary hypertension or who have frank magnesium deficiency.

The treatment, which raised urinary magnesium excretion 30%, induced no general effects on the blood pressure. However, when the changes in blood pressure in the actively treated group were related to the pretreatment magnesium status, a correlation was found between pretreatment urinary magnesium excretion and the induced change in supine blood pressure (P less than .05) with a blood pressure reduction in subjects with a low pretreatment urinary excretion of magnesium, and a pressor effect in the subjects with the highest pretreatment levels of urinary magnesium. The induced change in blood pressure was furthermore found to be inversely correlated to the changes in serum magnesium and urinary excretion of sodium (P less than .03) induced by treatment indicating that both a direct calcium antagonist action of magnesium at the cellular level as well as a diuretic effect of the increased magnesium load might be involved in the blood pressure effects of magnesium. Pretreatment serum potassium concentration also appeared to be a predictor of the induced change in standing blood pressure (P less than .03). In conclusion, magnesium supplementation does not seem to be effective in unselected mild hypertensive subjects or in subjects with a high-normal blood pressure and can therefore not be generally recommended.

Evidence for heterogeneity is based on measuring endogenous insulin level since some forty years ago. Insulin is lacking at the time of diagnosis in most patients, whose disease started rapidly, with classical symptoms, and who are mainly children, adolescents or young adults. In the majority of middle-aged, obese diabetics, insulin levels are frequently high at diagnosis. Since insulin measuring from sera became a routine laboratory test these two main types were nominated as insulin-dependent, and insulin non-dependent types (IDDM and NIDDM). The aim of the recent classification was, that different diabetic subgroups should be based on etiologic evidence. To avoid confusing nominations, the recent classification recommended to abandon the acronyms, IDDM and NIDDM, and only type-1 and type-2 should be used In the third subgroup-other diabetic groups--there are selected many disorders, whose etiology is mostly clear. As fourth subgroup gestational diabetes preserved its previous place. There are some differential-diagnostic problems in between type-1 and type-2 subgroups, especially between lean body weight type-2 and-the newly discovered latent-onset diabetes in adults (LADA). Diagnostic criteria of diabetes and prediabetic states are being changed according to epidemiological data, because type-2 patients die frequently from cardio-cerebrovascular fatal disorders, and elevated blood sugar values-especially postprandially-contribute to it. Thresholds of blood sugar values for diagnosing diabetes are therefore decreasing, and a new category: impaired fasting glucose (IFG, blood sugar: 6, 1-7.0 mmol/l) was introduced. Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) remained as prediabetic state. Oral glucose loading test in most problematic cases should be carried out. The clinical importance of postprandial hyperglycaemia (postprandial state) is discussed.

Effect of age and diseases on the pharmacokinetics of drugs was a research topic. Acute sotalol intoxications revealed its QT-prolonging properties, and even small mixed overdoses of moclobemide with serotonergic drugs proved fatal. Itraconazole and other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 could drastically increase exposure to drugs like midazolam, triazolam, buspirone, lovastatin, simvastatin and oxycodone, whereas rifampicin greatly reduced their plasma concentrations. A change from potent inhibition to induction caused a 400-fold change in the exposure to oral midazolam. CYP2C8 was revealed to be crucial in the metabolism and interactions of several drugs. Many interactions affecting statins are CYP3A4-mediated, but transporters are important in certain interactions. Tizanidine is very susceptible to CYP1A2 inhibition.

In this, our third exercise in cardiac anatomy, we address the issue of classification of ventricular septal defects. We begin our demonstration by analysing the normal heart. We show that the larger part of the ventricular septum is made up of its muscular component. The membranous part accounts for only a small portion, which is located centrally within the cardiac base. This small membranous part forms a boundary between the right-sided chambers and the aortic root. Holes at this site, therefore, which account for the commonest defects closed surgically, will open centrally in the cardiac base, being located postero-inferiorly relative to the supraventricular crest. We then show that the larger part of the crest itself is a free-standing muscular sleeve, which lifts the leaflets of the pulmonary valve away from the cardiac base. Only a very small part of the muscle forming the right ventricular outlet is located in the septal position. Turning our attention to malformed hearts, we show how holes between the ventricles can open centrally at the cardiac base, open to the inlet or outlet of the right ventricle or open within the substance of the apical muscular septum. We illustrate how it is the phenotypic features, as seen from the right ventricle, which convey the crucial information for the surgeon with regard to the location of the atrioventricular conduction axis, using hearts with holes opening to the inlet of the right ventricle with muscular as opposed to partially fibrous borders to emphasize this point. We continue by showing how holes with different phenotypes can also open to the outlet of the right ventricle, the key feature in this regard being malalignment between the apical muscular septum relative to the muscular outlet septum or its fibrous remnant. Malalignment can also be found between the apical ventricular septum and the atrial septum, this being shown in a defect opening to the inlet of the right ventricle. We conclude by emphasizing that, so as to bring together all the information of surgical significance, it is necessary to take note of the geographical location of holes between the ventricles, their phenotypic features and the presence or absence of malalignment between the septal components.", "source_id": "25547619", "source": "pubmed", "ctv_codes": []}, {"text": "This may be conducted by three mechanisms, of which the first is well established and the latter two are novel.

We simulated the spread of an antimicrobial-resistant pathogen across the healthcare network, and we modeled transmission within institutions using a stochastic susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic model. We identified the contribution of nursing homes to the dispersal of the pathogen by comparing simulations of the network with and without nursing homes. RESULTS Our results strongly suggest that nursing homes in the Netherlands have the potential to drive and sustain epidemics across the healthcare network. Even when the daily probability of transmission in nursing homes is much lower than in hospitals, transmission of resistance can be more effective because of the much longer length of stay of patients in nursing homes. CONCLUSIONS If an antimicrobial-resistant pathogen emerges that spreads easily within nursing homes, control efforts aimed at hospitals may no longer be effective in preventing nationwide outbreaks. It is important to consider nursing homes in planning regional and national infection control and in implementing surveillance systems that monitor the spread of antimicrobial resistance.

This review provides a brief overview of the chemogenetics toolbox with an emphasis on the DREADDs (Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs) technique used in rodent models, which is applicable to the investigation of how specific neural circuits regulate behavioral processes.

One important contribution of modeling is to demonstrate that proposed biological mechanisms can be sufficient to account for experimental results. To draw such distinctions, the connection between measurable biological quantities and developmental outcomes must be established. Perhaps the most important task for the future of developmental modeling is to deepen the connection between theory and experiment. Experimentally, this requires detailed and difficult measurements or experimental perturbations of the correlations among inputs and the intracortical connectivity existing during development. Simultaneous measurement of the maps of spatial phase and orientation of mature simple cells will provide important information for the understanding of orientation column development. How will inclusion of additional plasticity mechanisms, such as sprouting and retraction of synapses or plasticity of intracortical connections, alter the analytical understanding thus far achieved? What precisely determines the width of orientation columns in the model presented here? Can the relationship between ocular dominance and orientation columns be understood from developmental rules in a testable way? The existing framework may be extended to a three-dimensional cortex and to more complex models of intracortical connectivity. It may also be applied to other developmental phenomena including the development of lamination in the LGN (Shatz and Stryker, 1988; Hahm et al., 1991), the formation of visual maps in experimentally altered auditory cortex (Roe et al., 1990, 1992), and the mapping of visual and auditory maps in the optic tectum (Knudsen and Brainard, 1991; Brainard and Knudsen, 1993). For each system the goal is to develop testable predictions as to the patterns of activity and connectivity that could or could not lead to the results observed given a proposed mechanism of plasticity. Incorporation of deeper levels of biophysical realism will extend, deepen, and perhaps fundamentally alter the framework presented here. An important goal for the future will be to understand the computational and functional significance of developmental rules. Activity-dependent, competitive mechanisms of synaptic plasticity appear to play an important role in many processes of late neural development, where an initially rough connectivity pattern refines to a precise, mature pattern.

Evacuation of the uterus through the vagina is generally the preferred method in first trimester pregnancies. Dilation of the cervical canal by inserting rod dilators or laminaria tents allows the withdrawal of the fetus. Suction procedures (vacuum aspiration, uterine aspiration, or suction curettage) are possible since the decidua are separable from the basal layer of endometrium. This removal by force does not damage other maternal tissue. A cannula is introduced into the uterine cavity through the dilated cervix and its operator is then connected to a pump by way of a flexible tube which delivers negative pressure of about 600 mm of mercury. When the fetus is withdrawn, the uterus is felt to contract onto the cannula. Surgical curettage or dilatation and evacuation first dilates the cervical canal and then removes fetal parts and tissue from ovum forceps; a sharp curette does the rest. Anesthesia for these procedures may be general, local, or spinal. The techniques of menstrual regulation is used before pregnancy can be confirmed.

Obesity, especially abdominal obesity, is an important determinant of the risk of developing insulin resistance and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. It is suggested that a high proportion of fat in the diet is associated with impaired insulin sensitivity and an increased risk of developing diabetes, independent of obesity and body fat localization, and that this risk may be influenced by the type of fatty acids in the diet. Cross-sectional studies show significant relationships between the serum lipid fatty acid composition, which at least partly mirrors the quality of the fatty acids in the diet, and insulin sensitivity. Insulin resistance, and disorders characterized by insulin resistance, are associated with a specific fatty acid pattern of the serum lipids with increased proportions of palmitic (16:0) and palmitoleic acids (16:1 n-7) and reduced levels of linoleic acid (18:2 n-6). The metabolism of linoleic acid seems to be disturbed with increased proportions of dihomo-gamma linolenic acid (20:3 n-6) and a reduced activity of the delta 5 desaturase, while the activities of the delta 9 and delta 6 desaturases appear to be increased. The skeletal muscle is the main determinant of insulin sensitivity. Several studies have shown that the fatty acid composition of the phosholipids of the skeletal muscle cell membranes is closely related to insulin sensitivity. An increased saturation of the membrane fatty acids and a reduced activity of delta 5 desaturase have been associated with insulin resistance. The fatty acid composition of the lipids in serum and muscle is influenced by diet, but also by the degree of physical activity, genetic disposition, and possibly fetal undernutrition. However, controlled dietary intervention studies in humans investigating the effects of different types of fatty acids on insulin sensitivity have so far been negative.", "source_id": "10889798", "source": "pubmed", "ctv_codes": []}, {"text": "Recent evidence derived from four independent methods indicates that an excess triglyceride storage within skeletal muscle is linked to insulin resistance. Potential mechanisms for this association include apparent defects in fatty acid metabolism that are centered at the mitochondria in obesity and in type 2 diabetes. Specifically, defects in the pathways for fatty acid oxidation during postabsorptive conditions are prominent, leading to diminished use of fatty acids and increased esterification and storage of lipid within skeletal muscle. These impairments in fatty acid metabolism during fasting conditions may be related to a metabolic inflexibility in insulin resistance that is not limited to defects in glucose metabolism during insulin-stimulated conditions. Thus, there is substantial evidence implicating perturbations in fatty acid metabolism during accumulation of skeletal muscle triglyceride and in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. Weight loss by caloric restriction improves insulin sensitivity, but the effects on fatty acid metabolism are less conspicuous. Nevertheless, weight loss decreases the content of triglyceride within skeletal muscle, perhaps contributing to the improvement in Insulin action with weight loss. Alterations in skeletal muscle substrate metabolism provide insight into the link between skeletal muscle triglyceride accumulation and insulin resistance, and they may lead to more appropriate therapies to improve glucose and fatty acid metabolism in obesity and in type 2 diabetes.", "source_id": "11347757", "source": "pubmed", "ctv_codes": []}, {"text": "A pilot study testing the hypothesis of a blood pressure lowering effect of polyunsaturated fatty acids was conducted in Evans County, Georgia.

Guidelines for the person performing pharyngotomy were described in Rig Veda - the holy scriptures of Hindi medicine, about 2000 BC. Asclepiads of Prussia in Bithynia (124-156 BC), a Greek physician practising in Rome, is commonly considered the father of pharyngotomy. In the 1st century BC he documented an operation similar to pharyngotomy. Procedures similar to pharyngotomy were conducted by Claudius Galenus of Pergamon (about 130-200 AD) who was treating gladiators at the beginning of his medical career. A precise description of the technique in pharyngotomy performed by the method adopted from Antilla (3rd century AD) was presented by Paulos Aeginata (625-690 AD), whereas in modern times the first surgical pharyngotomy was performed by Antonio Brasavola (1490-1554) in 1546. In those times pharyngotomy operations were applied as life saving procedures and were associated with a desperate fight for life. All the experiences connected with the pharyngotomy technique were collected by Lorenz Heister (1683-1758) and published in his work \"Surgery\" in 1716. Until the end of 18th century the work finally established views about performing pharyngotomy operations. In 1856 Eugeniusz Bonchut conducted the first pharyngotomy in a child with passing an intubation tube into the trachea lumen. The operation was performed according to theoretical assumptions by Armando Trausseau (1801-1867), whose contributions to emergency pharyngotomy methods are enormous. Finally, at the beginning of the 20th century Chevalier Jackson (1865-1958) set principles for surgical techniques in pharyngotomy that still remain in force. The return to Sanctorius's method and also adaptation of Selinger's method (1953) of cannulation of blood vessels turned out to be fundamental for the further development of transdermal pharyngotomy. The first set for multistage, dilatation pharyngotomy was provided by P. Ciaglia et al. A one-stage pharyngotomy by special forceps was described by W. M. Griggs et al.

Classical pharmacological actions in vivo have been reported with dilutions as high as 10(-22)mol/L, but homeopathic medicines may be far more dilute than this. There is growing biological evidence including independent reproduction that in vivo effects may occur at such dilutions. In a systematic review, 73% of experiments showed an effect with ultramolecular dilutions including 68% of high-quality experiments. Physical and physico-chemical work suggests that homeopathic preparations contain stable ordered supramolecular structures, gas nanobubbles and dissolved silicates may be involved.

An assessment of the ICH's claims about the implications of 'technical' harmonization of drug-testing standards for the maintenance of drug safety, via toxicological testing, and the delivery of therapeutic progress, via innovation, is presented. By demonstrating that there is not a technoscientific validity for these claims, it is argued that, within the ICH, a discourse of technological innovation and scientific progress has been used by regulatory agencies and prominent parts of the transnational pharmaceutical industry to legitimize the lowering and loosening of toxicological standards for drug testing. The mobilization and acceptance of this discourse are shown to be pivotal to the ICH's transformation of reductions in safety standards, which are apparently against the interests of patients and public health, into supposed therapeutic benefits derived from promises of greater access to more innovative drug products.

Certain patients seem more than unaware, with apparent resistance to awareness. More extreme, and qualitatively distinct, is denial of hemiplegia. As accounts of its captivating manifestations grew, anosognosia was established as a prominent symbol of neurological and psychic disturbance accompanying (right-hemisphere) stroke. Although reports of specific neglect-related symptomatology appeared earlier, not until nearly 2 decades after anosognosia's inaugural definition was neglect formally defined by Brain, paving a path spanning some years, to depict a class of disorder with heterogeneous variants. Disordered awareness of body and extrapersonal space with right parietal lesions, and other symptom variations, were gathered under the canopy of neglect. Viewed as a disorder of corporeal awareness, explanatory interpretations involve mechanisms of extinction and perceptual processing, disturbance of spatial attention, and others. Odd alterations involving apparent concern, attitudes, or belief characterize many right hemisphere conditions. Anosognosia and neglect are re-examined, from the perspective of unawareness, the nature of belief, and its baffling distortions.

In this, our third exercise in cardiac anatomy, we address the issue of classification of ventricular septal defects. We begin our demonstration by analysing the normal heart. We show that the larger part of the ventricular septum is made up of its muscular component. The membranous part accounts for only a small portion, which is located centrally within the cardiac base. This small membranous part forms a boundary between the right-sided chambers and the aortic root. Holes at this site, therefore, which account for the commonest defects closed surgically, will open centrally in the cardiac base, being located postero-inferiorly relative to the supraventricular crest. We then show that the larger part of the crest itself is a free-standing muscular sleeve, which lifts the leaflets of the pulmonary valve away from the cardiac base. Only a very small part of the muscle forming the right ventricular outlet is located in the septal position. Turning our attention to malformed hearts, we show how holes between the ventricles can open centrally at the cardiac base, open to the inlet or outlet of the right ventricle or open within the substance of the apical muscular septum. We illustrate how it is the phenotypic features, as seen from the right ventricle, which convey the crucial information for the surgeon with regard to the location of the atrioventricular conduction axis, using hearts with holes opening to the inlet of the right ventricle with muscular as opposed to partially fibrous borders to emphasize this point. We continue by showing how holes with different phenotypes can also open to the outlet of the right ventricle, the key feature in this regard being malalignment between the apical muscular septum relative to the muscular outlet septum or its fibrous remnant. Malalignment can also be found between the apical ventricular septum and the atrial septum, this being shown in a defect opening to the inlet of the right ventricle.

The database currently holds 122 and 206 annotated combinations for P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, respectively, and their analysis allowed a systematic review of the available evidence on enzyme combinations, reliably illustrating the studies being performed. The most tested enzymes (e.g. lysozyme, DNase, lysostaphin) were scrutinised and the rationale behind each combination was explained. This research area is still growing although current research gaps/opportunities were identified, such as lack of biofilm testing and studies on polymicrobial scenarios. Hopefully, this work will shed light on the synergistic potential of enzyme combinations and alleviate some of the time- and resource-consuming tasks related to enzyme combination research by helping the selection and design of new enzyme-related therapeutic options for P. aeruginosa and S. aureus infections.", "source_id": "30639529", "source": "pubmed", "ctv_codes": []}, {"text": "The patient in the fifth family had a G>A nucleotide substitution in the splice donor site of one allele that results in an out-of-frame protein.

Potential complications include bleeding, injury to the common bile duct, trocar injury to the bowel, and spillage of bile and/or stones. The length of hospital stay and postoperative recovery are significantly shortened compared to standard cholecystectomy.
