Similarly guanethidine competes with noradrenaline at sympathetic nerve endings, but in turn is displaced by amphetamine-like drugs.Many acidic drugs (phenylbutazone, sulfonamides, coumarin anticoagulants, salicylates, &c.) are highly bound to one or two sites on albumin molecules.

When considering the field of the congenitally malformed heart, it is true that the richness of detail now provided by imaging techniques is truly amazing. Alongside these developments, there has also been a significant decline in the number of autopsies performed in tertiary medial centres around the World. In this review, we consider some of the factors that have contributed to this decrease in autopsies, and review the reasons why strong steps should be taken to reverse this trend. When considering the reasons for the decline in autopsies, there can be little doubt that the scandal devolving on inappropriate retention of organs, which came to light in the United Kingdom, but which had reverberations throughout the World, contributed in no small way to the reticence of families to grant appropriate permission to conduct a post-mortem examination. The inappropriate retention of organs came into the public domain in an attempt to emphasise the value of the autopsy in clinical practise, research, and education. All of these good reasons for performing the autopsy remain. From the stance of improving clinical practise, we reiterate that the attitude of the morphologist, working side-by-side with the clinician or surgeon, has always been fundamental in expanding this aspect of knowledge. We recognise, nonetheless, that performance of the autopsy still carries financial considerations. In this respect, when considering the congenitally malformed heart, we stress the option of having the pathologist working in harness with an experienced cardiac morphologist, or alternatively with a properly trained pathologist's assistant. In terms of training, we show how, with the advantage of a few simple rules, it becomes an easy matter to describe and analyse the congenitally malformed heart. Thereafter, having reviewed means of increasing the number of autopsies, and discussing new techniques, we complete our review with a detailed account of the fetal, perinatal, and paediatric autopsy in the patients with a congenitally malformed heart, taking particular account of the role to be played by the properly trained pathologist's assistant.", "source": "pubmed", "source_id": "18039403", "graph_score": 0.0, "embedding_score": 0.5068265199661255, "combined_score": 0.5068265199661255, "ctv_codes": []}, {"chunk_id": "22546125_chunk_2", "text": "Twenty-four embalmed cadavers were studied in the anatomy laboratory of Case Western Reserve University.", "source": "pubmed", "source_id": "22546125", "graph_score": 0.0, "embedding_score": 0.49851012229919434, "combined_score": 0.49851012229919434, "ctv_codes": []}, {"chunk_id": "15573356_chunk_1", "text": "Other complications are extension of infection laterally to the side of the neck or dissection into the posterior mediastinum through facial planes and the prevertebral space.

For the most part, epidemiological and experimental studies demonstrate an inverse association between magnesium and blood pressure and support a role for magnesium in the pathogenesis of hypertension. However data from clinical studies have been less convincing and the therapeutic value of magnesium in the prevention and management of essential hypertension remains unclear. In view of the still ill-defined role of magnesium in clinical hypertension, magnesium supplementation is advised in those hypertensive patients who are receiving diuretics, who have resistant or secondary hypertension or who have frank magnesium deficiency. A magnesium-rich diet should be encouraged in the prevention of hypertension, particularly in predisposed communities because of the other advantages of such a diet in prevention.

The effect of magnesium on the blood pressure is probably a direct vasodilatory effect which explains the ability of magnesium to reduce the maternal blood pressure.

We added 15 mmol Mg to a free diet in 71 subjects with mild essential hypertension or a high-normal blood pressure in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study over 6 months. The treatment, which raised urinary magnesium excretion 30%, induced no general effects on the blood pressure. However, when the changes in blood pressure in the actively treated group were related to the pretreatment magnesium status, a correlation was found between pretreatment urinary magnesium excretion and the induced change in supine blood pressure (P less than .05) with a blood pressure reduction in subjects with a low pretreatment urinary excretion of magnesium, and a pressor effect in the subjects with the highest pretreatment levels of urinary magnesium. The induced change in blood pressure was furthermore found to be inversely correlated to the changes in serum magnesium and urinary excretion of sodium (P less than .03) induced by treatment indicating that both a direct calcium antagonist action of magnesium at the cellular level as well as a diuretic effect of the increased magnesium load might be involved in the blood pressure effects of magnesium. Pretreatment serum potassium concentration also appeared to be a predictor of the induced change in standing blood pressure (P less than .03).

Intracellular magnesium concentration has also been shown to be effective on modulating insulin action (mainly oxidative glucose metabolism), offset calcium-related excitation-contraction coupling, and decrease smooth cell responsiveness to depolarizing stimuli, by stimulating Ca2+-dependent K+ channels. A poor intracellular magnesium concentration, as found in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and in hypertensive (HP) patients, may result in a defective tyrosine-kinase activity at the insulin receptor level and exaggerated intracellular calcium concentration. By contrast, in NIDDM patients daily magnesium administration, restoring a more appropriate intracellular magnesium concentration, contributes to improve insulin-mediated glucose uptake. Similarly, in HP patients magnesium administration may be useful in decreasing arterial blood pressure and improving insulin-mediated glucose uptake. The benefits deriving from daily magnesium supplementation in NIDDM and HP patients are further supported by epidemiological studies showing that high daily magnesium intake to be predictive of a lower incidence of NIDDM and HP.

Consultations were initiated during the second trimester in 46% (74/166) of pairs. Fifty-percent (83/166) of these consultations involved brain malformations, of which 55% (46/83) were also associated with other organ abnormalities. Brain malformations principally consisted of encephalocele, dorsal neural tube defects, holoprosencephaly, schizencephaly, cerebellar dysgenesis, and ventriculomegaly. Non-central nervous system organ system anomalies were observed in another 50% (83/166), in decreasing order of occurrence-cardiac, renal, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, in utero growth restriction, and hydrops fetalis. Maternal medical histories were abnormal for 65% of women. Placental pathology was abnormal in 80% (72/102) of available specimens, consisting of both chronic and acute lesions. Postnatal diagnoses were obtained in 128 neonates; 64% (82/128) remained the same diagnosis, 28.1% (36/128) had a worse or improved diagnosis, and 10/128 (7.8%) were normal.
